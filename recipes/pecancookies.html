    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Are you ready for some crunchy, buttery, pecan cookies with bits of chocolate-covered toffee bits? Who wouldn't be? They're easy to make and easy to eat! Keep cookies stored loosely covered with plastic wrap or in a cookie jar with a loose-fitting lid. An airtight storage container may soften your crunchy cookies.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda </li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature </li>
        <li>1 cup brown sugar, firmly packed </li>
        <li>2 large egg whites </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>¾ cup coarsely chopped pecans </li>
        <li>¾ cup chocolate-covered toffee bits, or to taste </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl; whisk until well combined.</li>
        <li>Place butter and brown sugar in a large bowl and beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add egg whites and vanilla extract, and beat for 1 more minute. Gradually add flour mixture to the bowl and mix until completely combined. Fold in pecans and toffee bits until all ingredients are well incorporated.</li>
        <li>Move the bowl to the refrigerator and chill for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.</li>
        <li>Scoop dough into heaping tablespoon-sized balls with a spoon or cookie scoop. Place dough balls about 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheet and flatten just slightly with the palm of your hand.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are set and lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cookies cool on the baking sheet for 1 minute, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
